Thank you for taking the time to visit my blog. I am a PhD student at Cornell University.

There are two guiding principles regarding knowledge that I hold dearly, and which I hope will lend some insight into the purpose and motivation of this blog:

## Knowledge as a source of humanity
What separates humans from other animals is a drive for betterment. We craft tools and leverage landscapes because of this drive. We gather resources and harness energy because of this drive. And although the consequences of this drive have positive and negative ramifications, there is no denying that the drive itself is a uniquely human desire. 

If we are to take this as fact, then it stands to reason that knowledge is the source of what makes us human. Without obtaining, distilling, organizing, and passing along knowledge, we lose the ability to chase after our drive. Any insights or ideas that one generation made would be completely lost when that generation is replaced, in which case the next generation would have to make those insights all over again. If dogs had the mental capacity and physical means to tell all other dogs not to chase squirrels across busy streets, dogs might just have a better time.

In this sense, we can only conclude that knowledge is akin to a currency, a currency so valuable and so rarefied that it represents the essence of humanity itself.

## Knowledge not as a means to an end, but as an end in itself
